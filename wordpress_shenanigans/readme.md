# How to put this wordpress shit on your xampp home computer

## Heres what you do:

1. Pray to all the gods you know. If you do not know, pick some here. [List of gods and goddesses](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gods_and_goddesses)
2. Get this zip to your xampp where wordpress/ is.
3. Name your own wordpress with different name. wordpress_orig is already taken. Use your imagination.  
4. Unzip it like a manly man you are. You handsome handsome hunk of a man you...
5. Change your username and password on the thing.  
    * Its in some wp-config.php or whatever. Honestly I am unsure about it. You know google. Use it!  
6. Put that wpdb-backup.sql wherever you put those databases and sh*t on the xampp. 
    * Again, Google it if you do not know. Its crazy what people ask on StackOverflow these days!
7. Get mysql-connection: 
    * Use phpmyadmin if you feel efficient. 
    * Putty if you feel adventurous.
    * Mysql Workbench if you feel like spreading butter with a broadsword. 
      * No judging you do you girl/boy/non-binary friend!
8. Change your url on the siteurl and home on the wp_options table on the wp-database.
    * You know its wrong if it has 192.168.50.xxx or whatever on it. it should be your computers own ip or localhost.
9. Open wordpress on your localhost/wordpress/, login, and profit
